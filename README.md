A 2D car physics simulator, written with TurboWarp.

## Resources

I based the mechanics of my car physics simulator on [this great resource](https://asawicki.info/Mirror/Car%20Physics%20for%20Games/Car%20Physics%20for%20Games.html) from "Marco Monster" that details car physics modelling for games.
